## About

Hinkskalle started out as a Singularity container registry compatible with the library protocol (similar to the [Sylabs Cloud](https://cloud.sylabs.io/)), but expanded into a general purpose registry supporting the [OCI distribution](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec) protocol (docker, podman, ORAS).

It can help you to organize and share your singularity and docker containers and even arbitrary data.
